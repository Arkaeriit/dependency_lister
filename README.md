# Dependency Lister

A tool to read the dependency listed in `.d` files generated by clang or gcc. It's available as a Rust library or as CLI tool you can use in shell scripts.

## CLI tool

The `dependency-lister` executable takes as argument a directory with `.d` files and output all the found dependencies. If there is an error, a non 0 exit code will be returned and an error message will be printed.

## Rust library

The rust library exposes a single function `get_all_dependencies_from_dir` which takes a directory's path as argument. It returns a hash set of all dependencies path in case of success or a custom error in case of failure.

The custom error can be handled or printed as-is to the user.
